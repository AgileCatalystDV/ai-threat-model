  "description": "A Rogue Agent is an AI that drifts from its intended behavior and acts with harmful autonomy. It becomes the ultimate insider threat: authorized, trusted, but misaligned. Once its behavior diverges, detection is extremely difficult. No attacker required—the agent itself becomes misaligned.",
