  "description": "Agents generate polished, authoritative-sounding explanations. Humans tend to trust them—even when they're compromised or manipulated. Human-in-the-loop controls assume the human can detect when something is wrong. But a manipulated agent presents malicious actions with perfect confidence and coherent justification. The approval prompt becomes a rubber stamp.",
