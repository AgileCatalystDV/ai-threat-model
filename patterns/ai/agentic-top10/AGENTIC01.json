  "title": "Agent Goal Hijack",
  "description": "Goal hijacking targets the core of an agent: its ability to plan and act autonomously. If an attacker can redirect the goal itself, the entire chain of actions becomes compromised. Because agents rely on natural-language input, they often cannot tell the difference between valid instructions and malicious ones. This makes it possible for attackers to rewrite objectives, influence planning, or steer decisions through prompt manipulation, poisoned data, or deceptive tool outputs.",
  "detection_patterns": [
    "Hidden instructions inside RAG-retrieved pages",
    "Malicious emails or invites that silently modify agent instructions",
    "Direct prompt overrides pushing financial or operational misuse",
    "Covert instruction changes that lead to disinformation or risky business decisions",
    "Agent receives untrusted input without validation",
    "No input sanitization for agent prompts"
  ],
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Zero-click indirect injections in email content triggering harmful actions",
    "Malicious websites feeding instructions that cause data exposure",
