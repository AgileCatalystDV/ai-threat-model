  "description": "Agents gain real-world power through the tools they can access. When misled through prompt injection, misalignment, or unsafe design, an agent may use legitimate tools in unsafe ways, even without escalating privileges. This leads to data loss, exfiltration, workflow manipulation, and resource abuse.",

    "Tools granted far more permissions than needed",
    "Agents forwarding untrusted input directly to shell or DB tools",
    "Unsafe browsing or federated requests",

    "Malicious data that steers the agent toward harmful tool use",
    "No authorization checks before tool execution"

  "attack_vectors": [
    "Fake or poisoned tool interfaces leading to bad decisions",
